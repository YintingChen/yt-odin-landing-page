            By raising Spirit, the Qi stored can be used as energy to unleash
            powerful attacks of martial arts and Wizardy Spells. However,
            running out of Spirit will put the player at a disadvantage, so how
            and when it is used is key.

          <div class="quota-1">Apart from these technical blemishes, Wo Long is an exceptionally accomplished evolution. It doesn't have the same variety as something like Elden Ring, but its focus on Wuxia-style martial arts puts it a cut above its peers. It's a game where challenges feel exciting rather than punishing because the learning curve is so exquisite and mastery feels sublime. Team Ninja has really managed to push the envelope, and lovers of Wuxia cinema and action RPGs had best not miss this one. </div>
